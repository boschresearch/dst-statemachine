# Direct State Transfer State Machine Design

This repository hosts work in progress for a re-design of the
[dst-go](https://github.com/direct-state-transfer/dst-go) state machine.
See https://github.com/direct-state-transfer/dst-doc/issues/11.

The state machine design is written as plantuml files. For sub state machines corresponsing to registration and transaction phase,
the diagrams are also drawn using inkspcape tool as svg files.
All the sources are located in the sources directory and the png images generated using them are located in the root directory.

Use [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) tool to view and edit source files in svg format.
